# Introduction

So now a days...Addiction is a well researched and no longer a taboo, but I found no one talks about one type of addiction which honestly we all are guitly of on some level and some of us are basically in a toxic relationship with it. It is Addiction to Mindless Content. Let Me Dive Into It...

# I Want More

Ever noticed how once you open instagram and start to the explore section or the reels, 2 hours passes and we barely notice. Well you think yhou are alone in that, but you are not. There is a reason why facebook is a multibillon unicorn. It gives us something we all secretly crave...**CONTENT**.

I am the last person to encourage all that stay away from facebook because blah blah blah, but recently I observed something that really shook me. I figured that I was spending all day wasting my time from a single video I clicked in the morning. My brain could not be focused on a single task unless I was mindless browsing the web. Blogs, Instagram, Chats, YouTube, all of these, I craved continuously.

# Why

So I am no pychologist and I can only speak from personal experince, but I am quite convinced that it is a vicious cycle that I formed in my head. It looks something like this.

I have found that all my productivity is lost by the time this cycle is over and the day goes to nil. Actually me writing this article too is a waste of time when I can be reading for my exams.

# What to Do

It is not easy at all to escape from this unfulling addiction...but it is possible. **I am not free of this Myself** but atleast I am trying. Try to do something productive. Want to watch a youtube video...fine, but only for sometime. Try to be in a more public settings, ie with your family and friends. This helps in guit tripping you to be productive. 

# Conclusion

Finally, I just want to end with the fact that do treat this as an addiction and just give it a second thought...the next time you click on that youtube video early in the morning. Hope you have a great day.
