## Introduction

Okay...I have to be completely honest here, I love CLI's.

They are just so nice, easy and super cool. Okay they do look nerdy but with the correct customization, they look quite elegant.

![Terminal](https://ubuntucommunity.s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/original/2X/f/f5787298cfda955e0e223f461e962d7dc8c376cc.png#center)

The main reason I like the command line interface is because of the control it gives me over the system.
Using the Command Line Interface is in my opinion the best way to use your computer. Personally, my productivity increases 10 fold
on my favourite terminal.

> My Current Favourite is [KDE Terminal]()

In this CLI Series I will explore one of the best cli tools and cli configurations that once you start using, you will be hooked!
